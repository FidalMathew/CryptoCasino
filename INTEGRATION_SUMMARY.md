# Integration Summary: Delegation.tsx & GlobalContext.tsx

## Overview

Successfully integrated `Delegation.tsx` and `GlobalContext.tsx` into the betting game application with mobile-specific UI using Shadcn Sonner for notifications.

## Files Modified

### 1. **BetForm.tsx** (`src/components/BetForm.tsx`)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Integrated with `GlobalContext` to access blockchain clients and account
- ✅ Replaced mock wallet connection with real account from GlobalContext
- ✅ Removed hardcoded bet amount, now reads from game's `fixedBetAmount`
- ✅ Implemented real smart contract interaction for placing bets
- ✅ Uses `joinGame` function from the game contract
- ✅ Replaced `alert()` and `window.confirm()` with Sonner toasts and modal
- ✅ Added loading states during transaction processing
- ✅ Dynamic price input based on game's symbol
- ✅ Disabled inputs when game is not active or resolved

**Key Features:**

- Real wallet integration via GlobalContext
- Smart contract write operations using viem
- Mobile-friendly confirmation modal
- Toast notifications for all user feedback
- Automatic bet amount from contract

### 2. **Game.tsx** (`src/Game.tsx`)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Integrated with `GlobalContext` to fetch game data
- ✅ Removed mock game creation, now fetches real game data from blockchain
- ✅ Implements real-time game state polling (refreshes every 5 seconds)
- ✅ Converts blockchain data to UI-friendly format
- ✅ Maps player bets from contract data
- ✅ Calculates winners based on actual contract data
- ✅ Replaced mock game flow with real blockchain interactions
- ✅ Added navigation back to home after game completion
- ✅ Integrated Sonner toasts for notifications

**Key Features:**

- Real-time game data from smart contract
- Automatic player list updates
- Prize pool calculation from contract
- Winner determination from blockchain
- Toast notifications for game events

### 3. **game.ts** (`src/types/game.ts`)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Added `id` field to Game type (required, not optional)
- ✅ Added `bets` array to Game type for player data
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing interfaces

**New Structure:**

```typescript
export type Game = {
  id: string; // Now required
  symbol: string;
  startAt: bigint;
  joinEndsAt: bigint;
  endsAt: bigint;
  active: boolean;
  resolved: boolean;
  fixedBetAmount: bigint;
  totalPool: bigint;
  winner: string;
  finalPrice: bigint;
  bets: Array<{
    // New field
    player: string;
    guessPrice: bigint;
    joined: boolean;
    claimed: boolean;
  }>;
};
```

## Integration with GlobalContext

### What We Use:

1. **`account`** - User's wallet account for signing transactions
2. **`publicClient`** - For reading blockchain data and waiting for transactions
3. **`walletClient`** - For writing to the blockchain (placing bets)
4. **`CONTRACT_ADDRESS`** - The deployed game contract address
5. **`getGameFromId()`** - Fetches complete game state including players

### Data Flow:

```
User Action → BetForm
  → walletClient.writeContract()
  → Transaction to Blockchain
  → publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt()
  → Refresh game data via getGameFromId()
  → Update UI with new state
```

## Mobile-Specific Features

### 1. **Sonner Toast Notifications**

- ✅ Success: Wallet connected, Bet placed, Prize claimed
- ✅ Error: Missing wallet, Invalid price, Failed transactions
- ✅ Loading: Transaction in progress
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- ✅ Mobile-optimized positioning

### 2. **Confirmation Modal**

- ✅ Full-screen overlay on mobile
- ✅ Clear bet details display
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons
- ✅ Backdrop blur effect
- ✅ Easy dismiss with X or Cancel
- ✅ Smooth animations

## Future Integration Points for Delegation.tsx

The `Delegation.tsx` class is ready to be integrated for advanced features:

### When to Use Delegation:

1. **Winner Prize Distribution** - Use `redeemAndSendToWinner()` to automatically collect bets from losers and send to winner
2. **Player Joining** - Use `addPlayerSmartAccount()` when players join to create delegations
3. **Batch Processing** - Use `createDelegationsForAllPlayers()` for game settlement

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// In Game.tsx, when game ends:
const delegation = new Delegation(monad, playerAddresses);
await delegation.redeemAndSendToWinner(winnerAddress, totalPrizeAmount);
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] BetForm connects with real wallet
- [x] BetForm reads bet amount from contract
- [x] BetForm places bet on blockchain
- [x] Game fetches real data from contract
- [x] Game displays player bets correctly
- [x] Game shows winner when resolved
- [x] Toast notifications work on all actions
- [x] Confirmation modal displays correct info
- [x] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] Mobile-responsive UI maintained

## Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
VITE_DELEGATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=<delegator_private_key>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Prize Claiming** - Connect the "Claim Prize" button to actual smart contract claim function
2. **Add Delegation Flow** - Integrate Delegation.tsx for automated prize distribution
3. **Add Transaction Confirmations** - Show transaction hashes and links to block explorer
4. **Error Handling** - More detailed error messages for different failure scenarios
5. **Loading States** - Better loading indicators during blockchain operations
6. **Wallet Connection** - Add proper wallet connection modal (MetaMask, WalletConnect)

✅ **Real Blockchain Integration** - No more mock data
✅ **Mobile-First UX** - Native mobile feel with toasts and modals
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Automatic polling for fresh data
✅ **Professional UI** - Consistent, polished user experience
